**Project 1: Credibility Score for Articles/Sources/References**

The objective is to assess the credibility of articles, sources, or references through a credibility score. This proof of concept is grounded in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm, which has become increasingly important in modern AI applications for providing accurate, source-backed responses. In today's information-rich environment, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available sources, making it difficult to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information. This project addresses this critical need by developing an automated system that can evaluate source credibility in real-time.
