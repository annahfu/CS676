**Project 1: Credibility Score for Articles/Sources/References**

The objective is to assess the credibility of articles, sources, or references through a credibility score. This proof of concept is grounded in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm, which has become increasingly important in modern AI applications for providing accurate, source-backed responses. In today's information-rich environment, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available sources, making it difficult to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information. This project addresses this critical need by developing an automated system that can evaluate source credibility in real-time.


**Project 2: TinyTroupe for Simulation**

This project proposes an AI-first solution to simulate user feedback for features by modeling different customer personas through sophisticated agent-based simulation. The approach leverages artificial intelligence to create virtual users that behave according to realistic persona characteristics, providing rapid, cost-effective feedback that can inform design decisions early in the development process. By using AI agents to simulate diverse user perspectives, companies can test multiple feature variations quickly and identify potential issues before committing to expensive user studies.


**Project 3: Retail Item Classifier**

This machine-learning application enables retail teams and inventory managers to quickly determine the correct store section for any item. By entering a product name such as “bananas” or “chicken breast,” users receive an instant prediction along with a confidence score. The model is trained on a broad dataset spanning all major supermarket categories and uses TF-IDF text features, n-gram analysis, and a Random Forest classifier to handle both simple and complex product names. By combining machine learning with rule-based refinement, the system delivers highly accurate, detailed classifications even when item descriptions are messy or ambiguous. This automation reduces manual categorization work, improves data consistency, and helps analysts understand retail department structures more efficiently. Deployed on Hugging Face, the tool offers a fast, accessible solution for standardizing retail data and supporting real-world analytics workflows.
