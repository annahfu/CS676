# Chatbot UI Guidelines for Credibility Scores
- Use a small badge (High/Medium/Low + score) next to responses.
- Expandable section for 'Why this score?' with contributors and thresholds.
- On timeout/fallback, show 'heuristic estimate due to system load' note.
- On error, show grey 'Credibility: unavailable' and provide retry.
